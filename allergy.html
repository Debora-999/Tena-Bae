                If someone is experiencing an allergic reaction, follow these steps: <br>

1. Assess the Situation <br>
Determine the severity of the reaction. Symptoms can range from mild to severe (anaphylaxis). <br>
2. Mild Reaction <br>
Symptom Management: If symptoms include mild itching, hives, or sneezing: <br>
Administer antihistamines (if available and the person is not allergic to them). <br>
Keep the person calm and comfortable. <br>
3. Severe Reaction (Anaphylaxis) <br>
Call Emergency Services: Dial emergency services immediately. <br>
Administer Epinephrine: If the person has an auto-injector (EpiPen): <br>
Administer the injection into the outer thigh, holding it in place for about 10 seconds. <br>
Positioning: Lay the person down and elevate their legs if possible, unless they are having difficulty breathing. In that case, allow them to sit up. <br>
4. Monitor Symptoms <br>
Keep an eye on the person's breathing and consciousness. Be prepared to perform CPR if they become unresponsive. <br>
5. Stay with the Person <br>
Do not leave them alone. Provide reassurance and keep them calm until help arrives. <br>
6. Follow-Up Care <br>
Once emergency responders arrive, provide them with information about the allergen and any treatments given. <br>
Important Notes <br>
Avoid giving food or drink in case of severe reactions. <br>
If the person has a known allergy, ensure they have an action plan in place for future reactions. <br>
Stay calm and act quickly to help!

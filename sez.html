              <h4>
                If someone is having a seizure, follow these steps to provide first aid: <br>

1. Stay Calm <br>
   - Keep calm to help the person and those around you. <br>

. Protect the Person <br>
   - Move any nearby objects that could cause injury. <br>
   - If possible, gently guide them to the ground to prevent injury from falling. <br>

3. Positioning <br>
   - Place the person on their side to help keep the airway clear and allow any fluids to drain. <br>

 4. Timing the Seizure <br>
   - Note the duration of the seizure. If it lasts longer than 5 minutes, call emergency services. <br>

5. Do Not <br>
   - Do not hold the person down or restrain them. <br>
   - Do not put anything in their mouth; this can cause injury. <br>

6. After the Seizure <br>
   - Once the seizure stops, stay with the person and offer reassurance as they regain consciousness. <br>
   - They may be confused or disoriented; this is normal. <br>

7. Monitor for Complications <br>
   - Look for any signs of injury or difficulty breathing once they are alert. <br>

8. **When to Seek Help <br>
   - Call emergency services <br>
     - It’s the person’s first seizure. <br>
     - The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes. <br>
     - They have another seizure shortly after. <br>
     - They do not regain consciousness. <br>
Important Notes <br>
- Encourage the person to see a healthcare provider for further evaluation if they have not been diagnosed with a seizure disorder. <br>
- Educate those around you about seizure first aid. <br>

Stay safe and be prepared!

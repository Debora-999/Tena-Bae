               Asthma is a chronic condition that affects the airways in the lungs. Hereâ€™s what you need to know about managing an asthma attack: <br>

Signs of an Asthma Attack <br>
- Wheezing or coughing <br>
- Shortness of breath <br>
- Chest tightness or pain <br>
- Difficulty talking or performing normal activities <br>
- Rapid breathing <br>

Immediate Actions <br>
1. Stay Calm: Reassure the person and help them stay calm, as anxiety can worsen symptoms. <br>

2. Sit Upright: Encourage the person to sit up straight to help open the airways. <br>

3. Use an Inhaler: <br>
   - If the person has a prescribed rescue inhaler (bronchodilator), help them use it. <br>
   - Instruct them to take 1-2 puffs, waiting about 30 seconds between puffs. <br>

4. Monitor Symptoms: <br>
   - If symptoms do not improve within 5-10 minutes after using the inhaler, repeat the dose if advised by a healthcare provider. <br>

5. Seek Help: <br>
   - Call emergency services if: <br>
     - The inhaler does not relieve symptoms. <br>
     - The person has trouble speaking, or their breathing worsens. <br>
     - They are unable to function normally. <br>

After an Attack <br>
- Encourage the person to rest and monitor their symptoms. <br>
- If they have a written asthma action plan, follow it for further management. <br>

Important Notes <br>
- Avoid triggers known to cause asthma attacks, such as smoke, allergens, and strong odors. <br>
- Ensure the person has a spare inhaler and knows how to use it correctly.  <br>

Stay prepared and informed about asthma management! <br>

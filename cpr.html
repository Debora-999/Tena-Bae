              <h2>CPR</h2>
              <h4>
                In an emergency situation requiring CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation), follow these steps: <br>

                1. Ensure Safety <br>
                Check the environment to ensure it is safe for you and the victim. <br>
                2. Check Responsiveness <br>
                Tap the person and shout, "Are you okay?" <br>
                If unresponsive, call for help immediately. <br>
                3. Call Emergency Services <br>
                If alone, call emergency services (e.g., 911) or ask someone else to call while you attend to the victim. <br>

                4. Check Breathing <br>
                Look, listen, and feel for breathing for no more than 10 seconds. <br>
                If the person is not breathing or only gasping, begin CPR. <br>
                5. Start Chest Compressions <br>
                Position: Place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest, with the other hand on top. <br>
                Compress: Push down hard and fast at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, allowing full chest recoil. <br>
                Depth: Compress at least 2 inches deep. <br>
                6. Open Airway <br>
                Tilt the head back slightly and lift the chin to open the airway. <br>
                7. Give Rescue Breaths (if trained) <br>
                Pinch the nose, cover the person’s mouth with yours, and give 2 breaths (1 second each), ensuring the chest rises. <br>
                After each breath, continue with 30 chest compressions. <br>
                8. Continue CPR <br>
                Alternate between 30 chest compressions and 2 rescue breaths. <br>
                Continue until emergency services arrive or the person shows signs of life. <br>
                9. Use an AED (if available) <br>
                If there’s an AED (Automated External Defibrillator) available, turn it on and follow the voice prompts. <br>
                10. Stay Calm <br>
                Keep calm and focused throughout the process. Your actions can save a life. <br>
                Important Notes <br>
                If you are untrained or unsure about giving rescue breaths, perform hands-only CPR (chest compressions only). <br>
                Always seek proper training for CPR and first aid to be prepared for emergencies. <br>
                Stay safe and be prepared! <br>

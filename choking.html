              <h2>Choking</h2>
              <h4>
                In the event of a choking emergency, follow these steps: <br>

1. Assess the Situation <br>
Mild Choking: The person can cough, speak, or breathe. Encourage them to cough to expel the object. <br>
Severe Choking: The person cannot breathe, speak, or is turning blue. They may clutch their throat. <br>
2. Call for Help <br>
If the person is severely choking, call emergency services immediately. <br>
3. Perform Abdominal Thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver) <br>
For Adults and Children Over 1 Year: <br>
Stand behind the person and wrap your arms around their waist. <br>
Make a fist with one hand and place it just above their navel. <br>
Grasp your fist with your other hand and thrust inward and slightly upward. <br>
Repeat until the object is expelled or the person becomes unconscious. <br>
4. For Infants Under 1 Year <br>
Back Blows and Chest Thrusts: <br>
Hold the infant face down on your forearm, supporting their head. <br>
Give 5 firm back blows between the shoulder blades with the heel of your hand. <br>
If the object does not come out, turn the infant face up. <br>
Give 5 chest thrusts (using 2-3 fingers in the center of the chest). <br>
Repeat until the object is expelled or the infant becomes unresponsive. <br>
5. If the Person Becomes Unresponsive <br>
Carefully lower them to the ground. <br>
Start CPR immediately (30 compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths). <br>
Check the mouth for the obstructing object before giving rescue breaths. <br>
6. Continue Until Help Arrives <br>
Keep performing the appropriate technique until emergency services arrive or the person recovers. <br>
Important Notes <br>
Do Not: Slap the back of a choking person who is standing or sitting as this may worsen the situation. <br>
Seek Training: It's advisable to take first aid and CPR courses to be prepared for choking emergencies. <br>
Stay calm and act quickly!

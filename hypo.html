              <h2>Hypoglycemia</h2>
              <h4>
                Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can be a medical emergency. Here are the steps to take if someone is experiencing hypoglycemia: <br>

                Signs and Symptoms <br>
Shakiness <br>
Sweating <br>
Confusion or irritability <br>
Dizziness or lightheadedness <br>
Hunger <br>
Rapid heartbeat <br>
Blurred vision <br>
Immediate Actions <br>
Recognize Symptoms: If someone shows signs of hypoglycemia, act quickly. <br>

Check Blood Sugar (if possible): If they have a glucose meter, check their blood sugar level. <br>

Give Fast-Acting Carbohydrates: <br>

Provide 15-20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates. Options include: <br>
Glucose tablets (follow package instructions) <br>
1/2 cup (4 oz) of fruit juice or regular soda <br>
1 tablespoon of sugar or honey <br>
8 oz of low-fat milk <br>
Wait and Recheck: <br>

Wait about 15 minutes and recheck their blood sugar. <br>
If still low, give another 15-20 grams of carbohydrates. <br>
Follow Up with a Snack: <br>

Once blood sugar is back to normal, have them eat a longer-lasting carbohydrate (like a sandwich or a piece of fruit) to prevent another drop in blood sugar. <br>
When to Seek Medical Help <br>
If the person is unconscious, unable to swallow, or if symptoms do not improve after treatment. <br>
Call emergency services immediately. <br>
Important Notes <br>
If the person has diabetes, they should have a glucagon kit available for severe hypoglycemia. <br>
Make sure to educate those around you about recognizing and treating hypoglycemia. <br>
Stay safe and be prepared! <br>

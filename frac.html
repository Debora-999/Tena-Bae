              <h2>Fracture</h2>
              <h4>
                If you suspect someone has a fracture (broken bone), follow these steps for proper care: <br>

Signs of a Fracture <br>
Severe pain at the injury site <br>
Swelling or bruising <br>
Deformity or abnormal positioning of the limb <br>
Inability to move the affected area <br>
A "grating" sensation or sound when moving the bone <br>
Immediate Actions <br>
Stay Calm: <br>

Ensure the injured person remains calm and still to prevent further injury. <br>
Immobilize the Area: <br>

If possible, keep the injured limb in the position you found it. <br>
Use a splint or any rigid object (like a rolled-up newspaper) to stabilize the area without moving it. <br>
Apply Ice: <br>

Place ice (wrapped in a cloth) on the swollen area to reduce pain and swelling. Avoid direct contact with the skin. <br>
Seek Medical Attention: <br>

Call emergency services or transport the person to a medical facility for a proper evaluation and treatment. <br>
Do Not: <br>

Do not try to realign or push the bone back into place. <br>
Avoid giving the person food or drink in case surgery is needed. <br>
Important Notes <br>
Monitor for signs of shock, such as rapid heartbeat, pale skin, or confusion. <br>
Follow up with a healthcare provider for proper treatment and rehabilitation. <br>
Stay safe and act quickly in case of fractures! <br>
